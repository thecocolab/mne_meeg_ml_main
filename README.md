# `Machine learning on electrophysiology MEG/EEG signals`

# Course at [MAIN educational 2024](https://main-educational.github.io/)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/annapasca/main_ml_meeg_hands_on/)

In this hands-on session we will learn 1) how to handle and visualize M/EEG data and 2) some machine learning techniques to decode evoked and induced M/EEG activity. We will use the [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/) software package which has become a reference tool to process MEG/EEG/sEEG/ECoG data in Python, as well as the [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/).


The scripts have been slightly modified and updated from a previous [course](https://github.com/agramfort/22_main_ml_meeg_tuto) given by Alex Gramfort and Huber Banville at MAIN educational 2022
